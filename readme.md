# Simple Node.js Server

This is a basic Node.js server that responds with "Hello, World!" for any incoming request. It's created using Node's built-in `http` module and is a good starting point for understanding how Node.js handles HTTP requests.

## Features

- Listens on a specified port (default: `3000`)
- Responds with a plain text message, "Hello, World!"
- Demonstrates the fundamentals of Node.js server creation

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher recommended)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
